# Mecanum_Wheel_Car
Special wheels(mecanum wheels) are used which have rollers at 45 degrees so unlike in normal wheels where friction is always in line with the direction of motion of wheel here the direction of fricton is at 45 degrees so there will always be two components of force. 
Different combinations were tried out with all four wheels (making some in move forward, some in backward and not moving) to figure out all eight directional motions and to rotate on its position.
Each wheel was independently controlled with the help of motor driver.
